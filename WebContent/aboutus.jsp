Helping people understand their money and how to build Better Money Habits is at the heart of what we do. We're connecting our customers, clients, employees and communities to the tools, products and education they need to help make their financial lives better. That's why we partnered with Khan Academy in April 2013 to launch BetterMoneyHabits.com. It's a simple, conversational and self-paced learning experience that explains complex concepts through approachable content. This content is available for free to everyone-not just our customers. It's part of our long-standing focus on providing financial education and empowerment.
